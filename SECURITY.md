# Security Policy

## Responsible Use

Arcanis is designed for **authorized security testing only**. Before scanning any target:

1. Ensure you have **written authorization** from the system owner
2. Operate within the **scope** defined by the bug bounty program
3. Follow the target's **rules of engagement**
4. **Never** exfiltrate, modify, or destroy data

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security issue in Arcanis itself:

- Email: **arcanis.tools@gmail.com**
- Include: version, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

## Scope

This policy covers the Arcanis scanner codebase only. Vulnerabilities found *using* Arcanis should be reported to the respective target's bug bounty program.
